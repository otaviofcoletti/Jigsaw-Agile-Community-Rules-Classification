# Jigsaw Agile Community Rules Classification 🛡️

A machine learning project focused on classifying and analyzing community rules and content moderation policies using agile methodologies and advanced natural language processing techniques.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning and NLP techniques to automatically classify and analyze community rules, helping platforms maintain healthy online communities through intelligent content moderation. Built with agile development principles, it provides a flexible framework for rule classification and community safety enhancement.

## ✨ Features

- **Intelligent Rule Classification**: Automatically categorize community rules and guidelines
- **Content Moderation Support**: Assist in identifying policy violations and harmful content
- **Agile Framework**: Built using agile development methodologies for rapid iteration
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large-scale community data
- **Multi-platform Support**: Compatible with various community platforms and formats

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda for package management
- Git for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/otaviofcoletti/Jigsaw-Agile-Community-Rules-Classification.git
   cd Jigsaw-Agile-Community-Rules-Classification
   ```

2. **Set up virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # When available
   ```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
# Example usage will be added as the project develops
from jigsaw_classifier import CommunityRulesClassifier

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = CommunityRulesClassifier()

# Classify a rule or content
result = classifier.classify("Your community rule text here")
print(result)
```

### Advanced Configuration

More detailed usage examples and configuration options will be added as the project evolves.
